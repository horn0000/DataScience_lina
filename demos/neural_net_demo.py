# Load the digits dataset from the sklearn library

# Set the training data (8px by 8px images) and target labels (numbers 0-9) respectively.

# Create a neural network with the following specifications:
clf = MLPClassifier(
    hidden_layer_sizes=(100,),  # Number of neurons in each hidden layer
    max_iter=1000,  # Maximum number of iterations (converges after ~160 iterations)
    alpha=1e-4,  # Regularisation to make the model generalizable
    solver='adam',  # Solver for optimized gradient descent
    verbose=10,  # Print a lot so we know what is going on
    random_state=42,  # Passing an int for the random state to ensure reproducability
    learning_rate_init=0.1  # Initial learning rate
)

# Fit the model to the training data

# Make predictions on the test set
